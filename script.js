    "Happy Birthday mooo moo! THANKYOU moo for everything. All the hardwork you have done, all those efforts to raise a boy like me. I have seen my mumma cry when I have failed, I have also seen my mumma shredding tears when I cracked IIT. I have seen my moo stay up all night so that I can have a proper sleep the night before my JEE mains and advance. I have seen my moo praying day in and day out when I had sinovitis. I have seen my moo cry when I was leaving for IIT. I have seen the unconditional love of my moo so many times and all the little things I do are just my way to express my love. Aaj am very far away from my moo, like seriously we are in different parts of the country, but I want my moo to know that her baby is always just a call away, will come running home whenever she requires and I love my moo unconditionally. Thank you mumma for everything you have done. Am so thankful to you, for all your motivations, distractions, scoldings, sermons and mein aaj jo hoon tumhari wajah se hoon ",

Thank you mumma for everything you have done. Am so thankful to you, for all your motivations, distractions, scoldings, sermons and mein aaj jo hoon tumhari wajah se hoon . I love you mum mum❤️", 
    "Does my moo remember this day? its the photo taken after my board results, where I scored 97.6% So much effor of my moo. Just recovered from sinovitis, scared, but my moo handled me. She got me everything, read day and night on the internet how to score, checked my papers, monitored me as if mera nhi moo ka paper h. Ajj tumhari wajah se I can tell my marks to anyone without any guilt or something and am so thankful to you. Love u moo", 
    "This is a photo of my moo, on her birthday, just two years ago. Am sorry for the lack of gifts iske agle saal mein uski bharpayi karne mein jee jaan lgadi thi. Anyways See my moo she is so happy, we a happy happy family. My moo keeps the family together and she is the reason papa and I get the luxury to smile even when we are totally stressed out. Happy belated happy birthday moo!", 
    "This is a leti hui moo. She tries her best to stay fit. This photo was taken during covid when she would appreciate me for my mushroom sized muscles. She would make everyone kadha and ensure everyone stays happy and healthy and most importantly; entertained", 
    "This is a casual moo. I love my moo that we can be so frank, so funny each other. We get to roast each other (atleast you do), have debates and click funny photos like these. My moo also acts like a friend with whom I can share all my random thoughts, all my worries and she always supports me and guides me", 
    "This photo was taken when Papa had covid. There's a sense of tension in this photo, yet for some reason I find it so funny the way papa is posing. You worked so hard during covid ensuring papa theek rahe, mujhe door rakha and took all the risk upon yourself. That's my moo, always prioritising me and papa over herself. Thank You moo for always caring for us, and sahi kehna h logo ka, its a moo who makes a house a home, IDK who said it but I agree to it", 
    "This is my moo 9 June 2021, well I am very sorry shayd kuch kra nhi meine uss time pr as such, but here we are, ig is point tk mera iit nhi hua tha, tab moo ne socha tha abhi se 3 saal baad gullu ek website bna rha hoga jisme birthday k messages honge, wo iit mein hoga aur TATA se ispar kaam kr rha hoga? But anyways happy birthday my moo moo,", 
    "This is the proud moment for all of us. This photo is so happy so proud. Its the result of hardowrk of all of us. Almost 3 years of grinding, mocks, tests, sleepless nights, for this one iconic photo, I am so happy you and papa got to click this photo and I pray, I wish you get to click lot more photos like this", 
    "Today is the story of Moo's iconic IIT k samose. So many times moo said mujhe IIT k samose khane hai and after all this moo finally got to have her IIT k samose. I remember we went to eat those samosa and they were so mediocre that you said you probably won't buy them again but the feeling of having those samosas are so sweet moo, sweeter than the chutney being served", 
    "For this photo, let's jump back in time; the time for from my placements, or CAT or even JEE mains and advance. This is the photo of moo teaching punnu something and I clicked this photo, I clicked hundreds of photo like these, my moo looks so happy in this photo... and patli", 
    "Welcome to Kasauli! It's a jhagde k baad patchup krte hue moo and papa. Moo was so slim in all these photos. The place was as far as I remember was quite boring and moo was pareshan kyunki hotel nhi mil rha tha. But at the end, after a good night of sleep and some tasty food, moo came to a good mood", 
    "Remember this photo mum mum? this is the photo of u and Papa's anniversary. And after this we went to that ghoomta hua restaurant, Papa ne mujhe iss din fish khilaya tha jo mujhe bilkul bhi pasand nhi aaya tha. This was also just few months before my board exams and one day before I skipped my hindi exam for sinovitis. I remember you were always so worried about me at that time, but am thankful meri moo ne mujhe sambhal liya aur bhagwan ki daya se sab kuch shi hogya last mein", 
    "This is a PARTY MOO! My moo trying to do a cool pose With my other friends' moms. Btw ye himanish aur swayam ki mummy hai. Ye kya hi journey thi mum, finally jb ye end hui thi, boards khtm hue the, they were like a celebration and am thankful to moo for always being the strongest support I ever could have got", 
    "This is a casual Moo. I love all these casual photos way more than the properly dressed photos. There's something personal to these. I love casual mode of my moo when she is funny, make funny photos. These photos remind me of the daily lifestyle we have, how we used to interact in a funny easy way and how we truelly are. This post is for all upcoming casual moo's that I love my casual moo and my casual moo is my biggest source of entertainement 24x7x365", 
    "This photo is dedicated to the college life of my moo. Am really sorry I don't have many photos like these amd these are the rear few. But I want my moo to just remind that this is the moo who was able casually crack B.ed and LLB without failing in a single sem, while bearing a notorious child like me. Cheers to my studious moo!", 
    "Yes this is one more casual moo. Incase you are wondering what the hell are we doing in this photo: ye photo li gyi thi taaki apki twacha ki  rang aur meri JEE ki kitab ka rang, dono k gorepan ko tola ja ske. Sorry moo uss time pr dil rakhne k liye meine keh diya tha tum zyada gori ho but reality kuch aur h. Tum jaisi ho bhut sundar ho faaltu kisi se compare mt kro. My casual moo is so beautiful,  and dress hone k baad she can ask her description from papa", 
    "My tensed moo, I can get the feeling of a serious moo, who was worried, tensed yet showing no sign of any of it on her face to protect her son. I don't know what sacrifices a mum makes for her baby, there must be plenty, but all I can assure is they will be worth it mum mum. I promise to do my best to make you proud, forever", 
    "Moo torturing an innocent child by taking him to a mall once board results were declared. See, tumne mujhe sone tk nhi diya poore boards k time pr ki mein bechara ghoomte ghoomte so rha hoon. Waise falling asleep has always been a huge problem with me. I would sleep on bike, in the car, when i come back from college, on trip at 9 o clock while you are making dinner, you were so troubled by my sleeping schedule yet you never scolded me for it, thank you moo moo, itna pyaar krne ki zroorat nhi thi thoda daat deti to wo bhi chal jata", 
    "These are the covid times, jab mere baal thode bade hogye the. You will leave no opportunity to play with my hair. At the same time you will leave no opportunity to  scream at me to get my hair cut. Let's make a deal. I allow you to play with my hair and you allow me to keep my hair long. Do text me if you agree with this deal or not on whatsapp. Byyeee", 
    "that's a very young moo and a very young me, honestly I don't remember much of this time period. But it looks like whatever you are holding, I really really wanted it. Do inform me how were you feeling when I was in this small and in your hands. Was I an intelligent baby?", 
    "This is a diwali photo, a diwali close to boards, either before or after. We all look so pretty in this. I remember is photo ko meine apni dp bnayi thi and a friend of mine commented teri mumma kitni young dikhti hai and when I told you you were so happy. Ab whenever someone tells me this I make sure to tell u this. And moo will get plenty such opportunities in the future", 
    "8 December 2023, this is a photo of moo on her anniversay. This was anniversary where I both me and nani maa were present. Papa is gifting moo a rose, and everyone is so hepi hepi", 
    "Welcome beck to my casual moo. This photo was taken moments before we went to meet Gyanesh Uncle on his birthday party. That day was filled with moo's sermons on why I should become an IAS officer. Give me time, let me realise what are the pros and cons, and if I feel I am worthy or capable, mein khud hi tyaari krloonga. Abhi to mera IIM krwado mumu please please. Do your moo magic, be strict, give your all and as always be my support because aaj k time I really need it. Shayd mere result na aa rhe ho, shayd mein demotivated hoon and everytime I feel like this, I call my moo because she always supports me", 
    "This photo has another memory. This is photo when we purchased a flat. I remember tumne papa k kaan se ek dhaga baand diya tha and then you roamed around the fire. Shakti Nagar ghr mein mein kaafi time se nhi gya hoon, but there are just so many memories in that home. I love that home, and I really want to go to that home. Uss ghr ne mujhe IIT nikalte, boards k liye padte dekha hai, but most importantly, ye wahi ghr h jisme moo ne mujhe daanta padhaya and pyaar kra hai", 
    "Sometimes candid photos of my moo are so beautiful. I live this photo, it has a sort of memory vibes to it. When I was making this website, I had a painful realisation, these casual photos of moo are decreasing, and it was apparent, I dont stay much at home, but it was a realisation which made me a little sad. I really want to spend lots and lots of time with you moo before I leave for IIM or Job or whatever. Call krdiya karo whenever you miss me please. Thankyou. Love you moo", 
    "One more photo of my preparation. Sometimes I feel like zindagi bhr meine preparation hi kari hai kya😂. See the notebooks. So weird things were there. Bhai ki Padhayi youtube channel, to NCERT padte rehna, Genius k notes jugadna and then there were you, always listening to all my banters and giving this child all the attention he needed", 
    "This ig the first time we visited papa ka punjabi bagh office. Its kinda funny how papa always follows me wherever I go. I just joined FIITJEE and papa ka transfer ounjabi bagh hogya. sach sach btao kuch h aisa to. Anyways look at my moo sitting, taking photos with papa", 
    "My moo loves chotte babies...temproarily. Btao which baby is cuter. I miss sleeping in your godi. Itne time se I havn't had a proper sleep in your godi. earlier I used to sleep in your godi and wakeup perfectly arranged on the bed like magic. Ab when I wake up, I wake up either with a neckache or totally crouched in my small bed of hostel or PG. I miss my moo's Godi. Next time jab bhi ghar aaon please ek baar mujhe apni godi mein sula dena. Love you moo", 
    "This is my moo with her 3 sisters. Meri taraf se unhe ek baar thank you zaroor bolna kyunki unhone videos bnakr bhejdi and I really hope tumhe birthday ka mera chotta sa gift pasand aaya ho.", 
    "This is us roaming in Vrindavan, We visited so many places, the birth place of lord Krishna and you narrated me the whole story of mahabharat at night. ", 
    "hi moo! This is photo of didi living in our building getting married. I honestly went there just for the food, but now that I look back at it, i don't remember anything regarding this. I just went for the food.", 
    "Do you remember where this is? this is a photo of us at red fort. Honestly I wasn't much excited about red fort but am glad I went there. The red fort was so beautiful. I remember I had to submit a smartphone survey report something hence I had to directly leave for IIT delhi, and both you and Nani maa started to cry. Don't cry moo am always with you and am always just a call away. I love you mumma.", 
    "This is a photo of my moo with her saas and sasur. You always treat everyone so good and even tho papa and me hardly ever help you in managing the home yet you always ensure, ki jo bhi aaye they get to have a luxurious stay. Am so proud of my moo", 
    "One more photo of a casual moo. I love my moo. I chose this photo but I don't remember anything about it so how are you, kaisi ho moo Send me a photu of a casual moo, love you moo", 
    "Fruit juice; it brings back such a harsh memory. I waiting for the results sitting at home. You came home after a PTM. As always I was expecting baatein krta h overall shi hai types. But this was different. Moo pours me a packet of juice, and explains me how an arrogant teacher, Neha Ma'am told I am an undisciplined child who is not focused. You could have scolded me. But you didn't. You just told me to prove her wrong and work upon myself. And I was ashamed. I can take scoldings of my moo but I cannot ever allow anyone to shame my moo. AND i studied hard, hard like hell. I might not have scored that amazing in my 8th class, but in the 9th and 10th class, I kept on working harder and harder until I shattered all previous records. Love yo u moo", 
    "Hi moo! This is another casual photo of my moo. I live when we click photos like these. These are unfiltered photos, totally random, where we can smile, have a normal life, not running behind any competition or something, just a pause and enjoying the moement", 
    "Happy Birthday! Day 3", 
    "I have always loved train journeys a lot more. Having aloo paratha or paneer paratha or biryani. Train mein assembling that middle birth, playing chidiya udd, downloading movies taaki train journey mein dekh sake, I remember having all those little toys jo crax se nikalte the etc. More importantly trains was a place jaha koi TV ya distraction nhi h. And it gives an environment jaha tum apne parents se baat kr sko. Itni saari kahaniya, champak, misti doi sab train se judi h. Moo jb bhi time mile ek baar train se kahi ghoomne zaroor chalenge", 
    "Hello Moo, this is your favourite place: Choki dhani, you were so angry at that place ki tumne shayd se kisi owner ko bhi jhadd diya tha. This place duped us professionally however khana was still worth it. Even tho wo place shayd bakwas thi still it gave us a trip to spend time together and click lots of cool photographs, waise bhi photos dekh kr hi to hm aaye the", 
    "This is a photo of moo and papa going to a japanese park. You made poori's and aunty made sabzi. We also brought some sweets and had a nice picnic. I saw my moo playing badminton after such a long time and really missed playing badminton with you two. Next time jab bhi aaon we will definately play badminton or go somehwere where we could play something", 
    "How is the maggi? Throughout my stay at IIT Delhi, I have eaten all kinds of maggi, green chilli maggi, cheese maggi, friend maggi, half friend maggi, veg maggi, mayo maggi, and all kinds of maggi. You liked this maggi but I always miss that fried maggi you cook. Wo maggi ki plate jise mein chaat chaat kr saaf krta tha. You cook the best maggi in the world and best food in general. Thanku moo for all the delicious things you made for me", 
    "Upar ka nazara kaisa h moo? A beautiful photo of moo and papa looking at the sky. I love it when papa is relaxed and are having some quality time. And I wish I saw more of it. Share me all the stories when you come back", 
    "Just like Yesterday, I also love this photo. Its a subah subah ki photo. We had some very tasty parathas over here. We ate those parathas while we were returning from Vrindavan (sorry if I am not able to recall the name correctly, I remember the memory not name or date.) I clicked this photu just randomly. I really wanted this photo to be placed because tum kitni acchi dikh rahi ho is photo mein and this is for all the times you ask me agar tum acchi lag rhi ho...yes moo you are looking beautiful, you always look beautiful, you don't need to ask me or papa however if ever in doubt you can always ask me, and i will always be hepi to answer", 
    "This photo is so so dear to me. The emotions I had with this photo. There was so much hope. This photo was taken ig during my JEE mains, when we had endless discussions on the strategies, which college we can aim for, and a stress buster walk which also kept me fit. I remember, the tapasya, I would wake up at morning, solve book k qs jo tum check krti thi, go for a walk, come back give mock test, analyse, study. Hr ek point pr you were there to motivate me, monitor me and give me the boost jiski wajah se mein aaj bn paya hoon jo bhi choti choti meri achievements hai", 
    "My moo and her 2nd most amazing creation after me. You showed me this with so much excitement, the gobhi ka structure. I love gobhi ka paratha and gobhi ki sabzi, and please mein jab bhi hoon acche se khilana ye thanku moo for all the delicious food. Love you", 
    "One of the first times my moo came to leave me at my hostel. She was proud of me and I am so happy when I see the proud face of my moo. I wish moo mujhse regularly aaye milne, I could share my days and we could have long long baatein ki ab next stratergy hogi. Love you moo", 
    "Moo, you're the most magical mum mum in the whole wide world! Your hugs are the coziest, your smile is the brightest, and your love makes every day an adventure. I love you to the moon and back, infinity times over! Thank you for always being my best friend and my greatest motivator. You're my sunshine on cloudy days and my warm blanket when it's cold. Love you Moo", 
    "Your relationship with gol gappas aren't new. Do you remeber badri chaat wala? Shakti nagar mein tum mere liye kitni baar wo chaat pack krwake laati thi ya hm khane jaate the. Itni jagah ki chaat khali lekin uski chaat ka alag hi taste tha. Ek baar time mile to let's go to shakti nagar and eat badri chaat with those spicy gol gappas", 
    "I took my moo to holistic, where she had juice in the summers. She probably didn't like it much still she just like always said, accha hai. I will make you a very tasty mojito sort of a thing the next time I am home. Bas yaad dila dena.", 
    "My moo worrying about nutition of the family at the middle of a trip. She took the whole responsibity of keeping the family healthy and happy upon herself. my selfless moo. I love u moo moo. I promise I will eat a lot more fruits future mein, atleast try to krunga. Abhi tata steel mein I daily try to eat atleast one banana, tum bhi apne health ka dhyan rakha karo, apne liye tasty cheeze bnao, hmesha mera wait mt kro ki mein aonga to hi tasty cheeze bnaogi. And be healthy and fit. I am so happy my moo is dancing and zoombing. Proud of my moo", 
    "Me, my moo, my papa and nani maa, all people dearest to me in one frame, what else could I ask for in this photo. By the way, nani maa k in kapde ko zroor yaad rakhna, kl k post mein she is going to be wearing exact same clothes😂. Tum kapdo k maamle mein bilkul bhi itni kanjoosi na karna, khulke lena, I will gift you as many clothes as you want, I promise. Love you moo", 
    "As told yesterday, Nani maa ne same kapde pehne hue h. One thing no one gives you credit for, is planning all the trips. You always take the initiative, you always choose the location, go through reviews, plan the trip and actively take all the responsibilites. You are the reason behind every successful trip (and papa too offcourse but you are the head planning chief avisor) of all our trips. Thank you moo its, all because of you that me and papa got to visit so many places, I got to explore so many cities and thanku mujhe itna ghoomane k liye. When I hear stories of my friends how they never left home apart from school and coaching, that genuinely terrifies me and am so thankful to God mujhe aap jaise parents mile.", 
    "This photo was taken on my birthday, Its a photo of moo eating pizza, and cooked my favourite sambhar and uttapam and while college mein tum itni parties, aur bahr ka khate ho, but at the end moo ka uttapam sambhar ka door door tak koi competition hi nahi hai. Thankyou for working so hard to keep me happy on my birthdays. Love you moo", 
    "Just my moo casually sucking the soul out of that poor mango. Jokes apart I really miss eating mangos. Yaha TATA mein mangos easily nhi milte aur koi khata bhi nahi kyunki mango se chatt chatt ho jata hai. I really really want to eat pamgoes and IDK agar season ho, but tumhe aage kabhi bhi mauka mile to mango khila diya karo.

Thank you for always being my best friend and my greatest motivator.", 
    " My moo and papa going for a scooty ride. I miss those bike rides. I remember all those so vaguely. I would sit on moo's godi moo would sit behind papa. I would often fall asleep and moo would hold me tightly. I would keep on slipping yet I wasn't scared because moo was always holding me. Then we switched to our first car wagon R, and which has a separate set of memories. Pehli car to always have such emotions, I really hope mujhe bhi apni first car lene ka mauka mile jald hi and tumhe aur papa ko ghoomane le jaon. Love you moo", 
    "I cannot imagine celebrating a diwali without you. I don't know the rituals, or the aarti, but moo remembers it all.
